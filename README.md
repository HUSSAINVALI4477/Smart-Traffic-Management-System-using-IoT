Smart-Traffic-Management-System-using-IoT
A smart traffic management system (STMS) using Internet of Things (IoT) allows for the monitoring of traffic in a city through a centralized control center. The system uses sensors to provide data for analysis by intelligent systems. The STMS then uses this data to prevent traffic jams and congestion through dynamic traffic adjustments, such as traffic light optimization and entry alarms.
